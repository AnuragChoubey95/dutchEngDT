> Keep all dependencies as well as the following scripts in a single directory

> First you will have to run the train.py, and only then will predict.py be usable.

> Run train.py as : "python3 train.py example_file write_out_file train_method"
    where,
        train.py == script
        example_file == file with labelled examples
        write_out_file == file to write the serialized object to
        train_method == either dt or ada

> Run predict.py as "python3 predict.py model_file test_file"
    where, 
        predict.py = script
        model_file = file wth serialized object
        test_file = file with unlabelled testing data


The output of the predict program will be visible on the stdout of your system.
